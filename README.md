## 1. Clientele:
A client that needs a Web Application**(The term Web Application is more accurate because we are not building a static set of webpages)** to sell antiques and keep track of inventory. Have features for clients to easily navigate the **Web Application** for the purchases. 

## 2. Project description/goals: 
Our goal is to build an store **Web Application** geared towards selling antiques. 
In other words, it will be an online garage sale which would aim towards people that
are close to them. Somewhat similar to Ebay.  

## 3. Platform of choice:
We will be using Sublime Text as our text editor. We will be using PHP, HTML and CSS to create our Web Application. **(This is just a text editor. You may wish to talk about PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.)**

## As a buyer I can:
• access my order history. I can view my list of complete orders in detail. (1 feature)

• access a seller's statistic such as the number of sold item, number of item the seller have. (1 feature)

• access a cart that can add/delete/view details of purchased items. (2 features)

• save/hold/watchlist item before bid/purchase. As well as add and delete item from my watchlist. (2 features)

• access a checkout/payment where I can input my information to pay for my purchases. (1 feature)

## As a seller and a buyer I can:

## 4. Feedback for Features(16):

## 5. Estimated Time:
We estimate that we will need about 80 hours per person to complete this project. At a total of 160 hours.  
**Feedback: (Time estimates don't count decimals because the level of prcision to do so would mean that you have a complete understanding of exactly how much work you will accomplish..)**
