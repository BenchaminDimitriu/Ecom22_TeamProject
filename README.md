## 1. Clientele:
A client that needs a Web Application**(The term Web Application is more accurate because we are not building a static set of webpages)** to sell auctioned antiques and keep track of inventory. Have features for clients to easily navigate the **Web Application** for the lastest bids and purchases/sales. 

## 2. Project description/goals: 
Our goal is to build an auction model **Web Application** geared towards selling antiques. 
In other words, it will be an online garage sale which would aim towards people that
are close to them. Somewhat similar to Ebay. 

## 3. Platform of choice:
We will be using Sublime Text as our text editor. We will be using PHP, HTML and CSS to create our Web Application. **(This is just a text editor. You may wish to talk about PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.)**

## As a user I can:
1. access my order history. I can view my list of complete orders in detail. 

2. access my current bid by a order tracking page that displays my current ongoing bids. 

3. access my seller statistic such as its number of sold item, number of item the seller have.

4. access a cart that can add/delete/view details of items. 

5. access a checkout/payment where I can input my information to pay for my purchases.

6. save/hold/watchlist item before bid/purchase. As well as add and delete item from my watchlist.

7. access a contact page (form) from user to seller for inqueries. 

8. access a help box that allows to search/type in keywords and will provide with a guide page.  

## As a seller and a user I can:
9. view the homepage change based on the holiday.

10. access registration, login, logout, 2-factor authentication (as per class instruction).

11. view all products/catalogue.

12. view all product details.

13. access a search bar and navigation bar.

14. view a pop-ad of new featured item.

15. Notification to show recent sold item/bought item.

## As a seller I can:

16. track my listings and view how many users have bid for my products. 

## 4. Feedback for Features(16):

## 5. Estimated Time:
We estimate that we will need about 80 hours per person to complete this project. At a total of 160 hours.
