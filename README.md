Name of Team: The Crying kids

Contributors: Dimitriu Jonathan, Emmy Ea

## 1. Clientele:
A client that needs a Web Application**(The term Web Application is more accurate because we are not building a static set of webpages)** to sell auctioned antiques and keep track of inventory. Have features for clients to easily navigate the **Web Application** for the lastest bids and purchases/sales.

## 2. Project description/goals: 
Our goal is to build an auction model **Web Application** geared towards selling antiques. 
In other words, it will be an online garage sale which would aim towards people that
are close to them.

## 3. Platform of choice:
We will be using Sublime Text as our text editor. We will be using PHP, HTML and CSS to create our Web Application. **(This is just a text editor. You may wish to talk about PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.)**

## 4. Features(20):
• Registration, Login, Logout, 2-factor authentication (as per class instruction)

• Order history

• Order tracking

• Customer service system (ticketing)/invoice **(How many features in the ticketing system? The user creates a service ticket and then admins respond? 2?)**

• Cart **(add to cart, delete from cart?)**

• Checkout/payments

• Seller listing/sales tracking **(2)**

• Products/Catalogue

• Product details

• Localisation EN/FR **(This is part of the base requirements)**

• Save/hold/watchlist item before bid/purchase. As well as add and delete item from watchlist. **(add to and delete from watchlist?)**

• Bidder history (last bid)

• Search bar 

• Navigation bar **(Web application navigation is a fact of life. Is this a special navigation bar?)**

• Contact page (form) for the client to the store about any queries they have.  **(Who for?)**

• Pop-ad of new featured item

• Social media/About us page **(Unless there is interaction with this feature, it's just part of the static webpages and does not count.)**

**(Please rephrase everything as follows: As a user (or other role), I can do something)**

## 5. Estimated Time:
We estimate that we will need about 150 hours per person to complete this project. At a total of 300 hours.  **(Time estimates don't count decimals because the level of prcision to do so would mean that you have a complete understanding of exactly how much work you will accomplish..)**
