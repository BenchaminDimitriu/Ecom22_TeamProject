## 1. Clientele:
A client that needs a Web Application**(The term Web Application is more accurate because we are not building a static set of webpages)** to sell antiques and keep track of inventory. Have features for clients to easily navigate the **Web Application** for the purchases. 

## 2. Project description/goals: 
Our goal is to build an store **Web Application** geared towards selling antiques. 
In other words, it will be an online garage sale which would aim towards people that
are close to them. Somewhat similar to Ebay.  

## 3. Platform of choice:
