## 1. Clientele:
A client that needs a Web Application**(The term Web Application is more accurate because we are not building a static set of webpages)** to sell auctioned antiques and keep track of inventory. Have features for clients to easily navigate the **Web Application** for the lastest bids and purchases/sales. 

## 2. Project description/goals: 
Our goal is to build an auction model **Web Application** geared towards selling antiques. 
In other words, it will be an online garage sale which would aim towards people that
are close to them. Somewhat similar to Ebay. 

## 3. Platform of choice:
We will be using Sublime Text as our text editor. We will be using PHP, HTML and CSS to create our Web Application. **(This is just a text editor. You may wish to talk about PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.)**
